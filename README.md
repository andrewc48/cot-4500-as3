Numerical Methods for Euler and Runge-Kutta
#Description This program uses the Euler and Runge-Lutta method to approximate values.

-Solves the Euler method using the f(x) and given values for range Iterations and f(0).
-Solves the Runge-Kutta method using the f(x) and given values for range Iterations and f(0).

#Dependencies -This program uses no dependencies.
-There are no dependencies

#How to Run the program -The bash script to run the program is python main.py

-All values have already been input into the program for the desired calucations, so no input is needed.

#Contributors -This program was written by Andrew Chambers

-The program does use a code derived from the code in the posted slides of Dr Khanh Vu

#License -The program is licensed under the MIT License
